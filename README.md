<h2 style="color: #fee440;"> Lessons Learned </h1>

Being able to do anything with a software language. I think it will be used more than python over time. I even think it should be the language of introduction to the software.

Its use is quite enjoyable and the most up-to-date developing software language, especially its frameworks are quite useful. 

In general, I had problems with the installations.
